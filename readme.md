# PixivBatchDownloader Plugin

## Source 
https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivBatchDownloader

### Features
- Fixed some problems in the original extension
- Added some new useful keyboard shortcuts

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Arrow keys: Focus on the illustration
- S: Open/Close the user box  
- Z: Next page for artworks that have more than 2 illustrations
- X: Previous page for artworks that have more than 2 illustrations
- E: Add bookmark without downloading

### Notes
I recommend using Tampermonkey or a similar extension to automatically reload the script when viewing Pixiv. This will apply any changes made to the script immediately without needing to manually reload the browser.
